.# Abstract

This document defines the Matroska tags, namely the tag names and their respective semantic meaning.

{mainmatter}

# Introduction

Matroska aims to become THE standard of multimedia container formats. It can store timestamped multimedia data but also chapters and tags. The `Tag Elements` add important metadata to identify and classify the information found in a `Matroska Segment`. It can tag a whole `Segment`, separate `Track Elements`, individual `Chapter Elements` or `Attachment Elements`.

While the Matroska tagging framework allows anyone to create their own custom tags, it's important to have a common set of values for interoperability. This document intends to define a set of common tag names used in Matroska.

# Status of this document

This document is a work-in-progress specification defining the Matroska file format as part of the [IETF Cellar working group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/cellar/charter/). It uses basic elements and concepts already defined in the Matroska specifications defined by this workgroup.

# Security Considerations

`Tag` values can be either strings or binary blobs. This document inherits security considerations from the EBML and Matroska documents.

# IANA Considerations

To be determined.

# Notations and Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).
